**What's for Dinner?** is an online resource aimed at sharing recipes with friends to help people as a way of staying in touch during lockdown.

The primary goal of this project is to create  an online resource where users can share recipe ideas, ingredient lists, and browse for ideas on what to cook for their next lockdown meal.

## Project Background

This project is being completed as part of a Full Stack Developer Diploma award. This forms the basis for the developer's first milestone project. As such it will be completed within a set of guidelines as to which technologies to use.

While the core focus of the project is to be submitted as the summative assessment for the student developers course, it is also hoped that the resource itself, and the brand created for it can be developed over time into something that can be of value to the wider community.

## UX Design

### User Stories

With the target users in mind, the following user stories are generated.

- As a user I should be able to browse a list of available recipes by cuisine type
- As a user I should be able to view individual recipes, and see an ordered list of steps to create each one
- As a user I should be able to view ingredient lists for individual recipies
- As a user I should be able to see an image of the finished recipe
- As a user I should be able to create a new recipe to add to the shared database
- As a user I should be able to make edits to an existing recipe in the shared database
- As a user I should be able to delete old recipes from the database

## Technologies Used

In this section, I will mention all of the languages, frameworks, libraries, and any other tools that I have used to construct this project.

### Languages

- [HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/HTML/HTML5) is used to render the content of the website.
- [CSS](https://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/#specs) is used to style the content of the website.

### Frameworks

- Flask
- Jinja 2

### Libraries

- Materialize CSS

### Other Tools

- [Git](https://git-scm.com/) is used for version control in this project. Throughout the project, a Develop branch has been added to the project to allow work to continue on the website without breaking the functioning version on the Master branch.
- [Github](https://github.com/) is used as a remote repository for the site, as well as for deployment of the final version.
- Pycharm
- MongoDB
